LangChain is an open-source Python framework that helps developers build applications using large language models (LLMs).
LLMs are deep-learning models that are trained on large amounts of data and can generate responses to user queries,
such as answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts.
LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the information generated by LLMs, such as customization, accuracy, and relevancy. 


LangChain's features include:

Data communication
Vector embedding generation
Interaction with LLMs
Chat memory
Enhanced language understanding and generation
Customization and flexibility
Streamlined development process
Improved efficiency and accuracy
Versatility across sectors 

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle, including development, productionization, and deployment. 
For example, developers can use LangChain components to build new prompt chains or customize existing templates.
 They can also use LangChain to allow LLMs to access new data sets without retraining. 
 

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
langchain-community: Third party integrations.
Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their
own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
LangGraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. 
Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.
LangServe: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.
LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
